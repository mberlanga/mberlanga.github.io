I began as a science fair project worked on by a young lad named Samson Young. Course he was a middle schooler with no knowledge of actual science, but with a daddy who had a lot of money. Intending to see his Samson walk away with only a 1st place prize, he tried bribing the judges. But unfortunately each one had a conscious, so Samson’s daddy had only one option: make his son’s project beyond what science could understand to woo the judges. From around the world, he hired geneticists, biologists,  quantum physicists,  and even a homeless man who claimed “he had figured out the meaning of life” This squad of over-qualified Nobel Laureates plus homeless Jorus Ruckerson the 42nd from the 5th State of Alien-Citadel worked day in and day out to meet the science fair deadline. 

Nonetheless, I cannot a judge this father for wanting his son to win. It was from this vicarious living of his son that I came to being. As I would later find out, it all started from a simple potato chip. Samson had insisted to his father that he wanted to find a way to make potato chips healthy; and so daddy made sure to find a way to make them beyond healthy. While each scientist conferred globally across skype, email, and texts, homeless Jorus took matters into his own hands. 

With money beyond his greatest beliefs, he bought a ex-spec ops agent who was a double- triple-double agent back in the cold war. With precise timing and an inhuman amount of charisma and deception, Jorus’s agent broke into the CDC during Christmas eve in a Santa suit and fooled everyone. Each staff member believed that Santa in the flesh and blood was looking for his lost vial of smallpox that he misplaced. Of course knowing that anyone would help Santa, Jorus’s agent walked out the front door with a plate of cookies, a glass of milk, a handshake, and a vial of disease that could wipe out millions. 

As the fate of the world held in the hands of Jorus, the group of scientists Samson’s dad had hired began to construct one of the largest science experiments since the LHC. Code named the LHCC, the Large Hadron Chip Collider , Samson’s dad wanted to best the most well known quantum science project. The collider spanned the entire Atlantic Ocean in a ruffled chip shape underground. Although not an easy task to complete in a month, a godly amount of money from oil made it happen. Samson was more than excited to see how his drawing of a healthy potato chip in art class turned into one of the largest structures ever built. 

Despite 3 months of heavy research at the LHCC (or its other formal name “the Big Chip”), it was decided unanimously (and peer reviewed) by all scientists that there was no way to make a potato chip healthy. Bringing his results to the science fair, little Samson spoke in great detail about the huge budget that it took to determine this result. The incorruptible judges of the science fair could not tolerate this frivolous amount of money on a “useless project,” and so they disqualified Samson. But of course, Samson’s father did not take this lightly. In fact he asked the one last man he could trust to take care of the issue: Jorus. But no encouragement was needed to help Jorus let the world know “the meaning of life.” On that day, when little Samson got disqualified, the world became acquainted with smallpox by first name and last name. And that was me.
