Off the rushing waters of the Volm river lies the port city of Murkshire. Before the Pillage of Krunglelungus, Murkshire was a great center for shipping. The wealth brought through trade helped it grow into a beautiful, ornate city with rich canals and even richer patrons. But that all changed when the Orcs came. Under Krunglelungus’ orders, the city was razed and ruined. Its once magnificent carved wooden buildings were no more.
Murkshire was rebuilt but the restoration of the trade center was never complete. The close maze of wooden apartments and shops leaned rather than towered over the narrow passageways of the city. The once romantic canals became nearly stagnant as the debris from the razing clogged them. Both the city and its people had changed in character. The Murk, as it is referred to now, has become a central dwelling for miscreants instead of merchants.

From since she remembers, Finbar Fergus has lived her whole life in The Murk. Her very first memories were of the shoddy city orphanage that was barely held together by this fragile old human woman called Nan. Overcrowded and overlooked, the orphanage was more of a foster home for unwanted children than a place to adopt. With only one woman to care for and watch over 70 children, Fin became quite self-sufficient early on. She quickly learned to steal for meals and fight to keep her belongings to herself. Her time in the orphanage made her very possessive over her few objects and untrusting to new people.
After Nan died, the orphanage was being shut down as no one was willing to take her place. At age 10, Fin was kicked to the streets of the Murk. She spent her days pickpocketing and stealing whatever she could from unaware bystanders and roaming near the canals looking for trapped fish to catch. Although her size and quickness helped with evading guards, she had several stints in prison for minor crimes.
Fin got most of her entertainment from frequenting the taverns and eavesdropping on the unsavory regulars. The Smelly Bee was by far her favorite to visit. The dim, smoky, and crowded bar became as close to a home as she had ever had. Farnik the barkeep, a stout and grumpy dwarf, often would shoo her out the door with a broom but with time he grew fond of her and let her loiter by the fire. Farnik taught Fin how to read people’s body language and mannerisms. When dealing with a hostile town like the Murk, it was a necessity to learn how to pick up on peoples’ true intentions or read who would be easier to con.

Rumors in The Smelly Bee were surfacing of one Grunkle Sherkehs, infamous for the illicit drug ring he runs in the not-so-far-away city of Vayasuh. Him and his operation had gone dark. With the territory open there are now people looking to get a cut into the lucrative drug business. Finbar decided to try her luck and see if she could strike it rich by moving in on the new opportunities so she heads to Vayasuh.
