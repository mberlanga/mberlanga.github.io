"The Great" Schmol wasn't always so great; in fact he still isn't. He grew up in the slums of Schlongus, on the far side of the Twins from lake Esmull, his parents were extremely poor. His mom would spend time alone with strange men just to put food on the table. Everyone would always make fun of Schmol Josteen and call his dad a "cuck" because Schmol was half elf, but both his parents were humans. His mother quickly became addicted to Schlongian-Snuff-Snuff and died of an overdose. Schmol father immediately took Schmol to the Church of Kol Korran, the god of trade, wealth, and greed. The cleric, Bobby Barathemon, immediately put him to work as an assistant in running all sorts of schemes to rip of the public. Schmol would have to steal and scam everything he used, ate, or wore off unsuspecting townsfolk. Bobby would have Schmol pickpocket, and steal from everyone in the crowd while he performed tricks, miracles, and gave speeches. He quickly realized worshipping Kol Korran was his quickest path to wealth and became a devout follower of Kol. Under Bobby Barathemon's guiding hand, and the will of the great Kol Korran, Schmol quickly learned some new tricks. He used his newfound powers to become extremely wealthy and powerful. Unfortunately for our hero he ripped off the wrong person,  Sharniqafellina. Sharniqafellina was the daughter of Schlongus's crime family boss, Tyrelllonte. Tyrelllonte was furious and quickly had all of his family turn against Schmol. Schmol had to flee, leaving behind all of his wealth barely escaping with his life. He was last seen heading to Vayasuh  to start a new life as a traveling miracle salesman
