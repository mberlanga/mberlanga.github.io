Beep. Beep. Beep. Wrrrrr clunk.

“Ah sweet it worked!” exclaimed the figure wearing the green glowing watch. A candy bar now rested on the floor of the deposit, and upon closer inspection, the bar wrapper looked shriveled and worn as if it's years in the machine had been a non-stop fight club match. 

“Wow so from all the computers you tried to load this A.I. on, only this candy machine by the yoga center allows the boot-up?” They both took a glance around before the figure with the watch responded.

“Guess there’s something magical about yoga centers…” smirked the college kid holding the computer, his wrist still glowing a faint green. 

“Are we still talking about your A.I. or yoga pants now?”

“I’ll let you mind run wild there bro. Actually, can you hand me the drill in my bag there. There’s a few rusted screws here. I think if we can release them from the ground we can steal this bad boy… Red?”

“Yeah yeah I’m looking dude! Ah shit! Looks like we forgot to pack it.” Red got up from crouching and stood a full 6’ 3”. Swaying his way to friend down near the screws, he inspected the situation. Sure enough, four medium screws nailed each corner of the machine to the studio floor. Red began to tap his chin, and for a few moments, the only sounds in the studio alley were the impulses of Red’s brain ticking. 


“You know I still have some plastic spoons from lunch today in my backpack,” said after full minute of silence. “I never did end up eating my yogurt.”
Kelsen’s face began to twist to show a mix between confusion, disbelief, and utter loss of faith in his friend. 
“Hey don’t give me that look man, least it’s an idea.” defended Red. 

“Well, why don’t we invite the stuffed teddy bear club to lift this too when we’re done?”

“Eyy man, if they have the muscle I’ll go back home and grab some of the old ones I have.” 

“No forget it...forget it.” Kelsen put his laptop on the ground from his lap and began to inspect the screws once more. The machine continued to whir, and the candy bar down on the deposit seemed to be shriveling more onto itself as if the new air it was exposed to was suffocating it.

“Spoon…” Kelsen gestured his hand for an flimsy plastic utensil. Red was caught off guard. 

“Woah you just gave me crap for suggesting that”

“Spoon…”

Red walked over to the far end of the studio alley and  zipped open his flopped-over backpack and pulled out his lunch bag. As suspected, Red found his plastic spoon right next to the yogurt he did not eat. Red walked back with pride, “finally” he thought, “something I can help with.”

“Here Kels”

“Thanks.” Taking the spoon from end to end in both hands he snapped the spoon and handed it back to Red. “I don’t need it anymore. Well I really didn’t need it at all. While you got your spoon I unscrewed these by hand. Turns out they put these in pretty loose.”

Red’s stood in a moment of sadness at the now broken spoon in his hands. The yogurt would have to wait. Kelsen had just managed to free the shackles of the first candy machine A.I.. Any broken spoon paled in comparison as to what they were both about to discover.
