All the most notorious villains in the business have gotten somewhere by committing full scale crimes. The Kleenex got his name for breaking into the CDC and letting a dangerous virus strain flood the New York metro. The Good Bad Guy got his name by killing in twos: one innocent person and one wanted criminal in the same go. Heck even the Hot-Dogger places in a higher ladder than me. Though I have to say poisoning the hotdogs before the national hotdog eating competition was a spectacular show. 

I’m looking for my big break. Murder, conspiracy, mutilation, arson, mass homicide: the biggest names have done it all. Except me. Everytime I try it seems that the world wants me to be good. I just want to be as heinous as all the other villains. Even my friend the “Caballo” just made his big break. He just performed a big kidnapping against an ambassador's son. Talk about making a name for himself. Now everyone fears the man in the horse mask and business suit.

My biggest attempt last year to do a big crime was a disaster. I tried to assassinate the governor of my state with a switchblade, but tripped on melted candy bar wrapper and ended up stabbing another assassin who seemed to have the same idea that I had that day. My knife slipped past the governor's neck and straight into the chest of the other assassin. Unfortunately he was packing a pistol going for the gut shot which in this case was my gut. Instead of gaining rep in the villain world for my clean job, I received the “Citizens’ Key to the City” and thank you letters galore the entire time I was recovering in the hospital. Daemen, “the savior of the state,” they called me. 

After a year of recovering, I built up the courage to finally get my own firearm and get into some serious crime again. Assassination was out of the question this time around. Just too many things that could go wrong. I would start at a lower level. I figured I needed a bigger mastery of certain crimes anyways before I could really get thrown in for multiple life sentences. 



My crime that day was dictated by my low supply of cigarettes. I figured the local 7-11 would be an easy target. Walking in, gun in butt pocket (to look badass), I swaggered through the door and pretended look at the merch. Cheetos yeah, let them think I want to buy cheetos. Course as luck would have it, two police officers walked into the building as I purused the cheesy wares of the shop, and I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. I’d never thought about killing a cop before, and two? Oh man, I didn’t want the name “Blue Slurpee.” If I just act cool, they would be in and out. 

“Hey there buddy! You got a permission to pack in public?” His badge read: Lenny Miller PD. Shit I guess the butt pocket thing was only in the movies.

“Ahhh yeah. I left my registration at home.”

“Ah shit I know that feeling, isn’t that right Reggie?”

“Oh yeah man. Didn’t you leave yours once in a hookers place?"

“Fuck that’s right, don’t tell the old lady though,” the Lenny chuckled.

“Alright, well we’ll get out of your hair. Just don’t go robbing this joint alright, even if their cigarette prices are satanic,” Lenny winked and snapped his fingers toward me as if he was almost encouraging me to pull the job off right now.

“Actually you know what? Reggie, let’s show him how to do it if he were to do it.”

“Already ahead of you boss,” Reggie moved toward the cash register as he slipped the gun from his holster. The clerk looked from the magazine he was reading in sheer shock.

“Yo cupcake! Get yo hands up. Do you not know what to do when there’s a gun to your face?”

“Excellent Reggie!” exclaimed Lenny. 

“Notice how his gun is pointed sideways. It’s all in the angle. Now trust me I’ve seen newbies do it wrong all the time. 45 degrees is not 90. They don’t teach geometry to kids like they used too. Here get your gun out kid. We’ll ‘fake’ rob this joint together,” the officer motioned for me to pull out my gun and hold it out at the clerk. 

“Wow you’re a natural. With that grip, you’re making me think I should lock you up for robbery,” the officer laughed at his own joke.

“Okay now it’s always good to name call your victim. It really makes them feel powerless. ‘Cupcake,’ phew that was a good one Reg. You ready for this kid?”
I had to think for a bit, I was so caught off guard.

“Hey yo, you, clerk-face….Your hat looks pretty rad bro”
Lenny face twisted. 

“Oh nonono. Kid you need to demean him. Make him feel worthless”

“Pssshhh. What I meant was, your hat looks pretty *reddd.* As in the blood that will come out if you don’t give me like, free cigarettes.”

“I don’t mean to interrupt, but ugh, I’m not feeling it at all,” announced the clerk.

“Okok, it’s your first time kid. I’ll take care of it. But make sure you take some notes,” Lenny made a show of ripping out his gun from the holster and as he had mentioned earlier, tilting the gun a perfect intimidating angle of 90 degrees.

“Alright fuckface listen here. I may look like a cop, but I’m doing you no favors today. Reggie and I have no qualms killing innocent people who get in our way. Fuck Reggie and I just hit and run a jaywalker because it was fun. Wrapped his body in a black trash bag, threw him into the lake. Isn’t that right Reggie?”

“Yee you the boss Lenny”

“That’s right I’m the fucking boss. And the boss here needs some cigarettes. Gratis. You getting me yet, muffin man??"
Without hesitation the clerk jumped from his seat and started stuffing all the packs he could into a bag. The clerk handed the officers the bag all the meanwhile Lenny stared at the clerk like a serial killer. 
“And also, next time we come here. Just have the cigarettes ready by the counter so I don’t have to remind you of our previous conversation.”

“Yes...sss.sss.sss...sir,” whimpered the clerk.
The officers and I walked out of the store. 

“Wowww. Did you see the look on his face?” boasted Lenny.

“Yeah boss, you still got it”

“Damn straight I still got it. Phew. Here kid, take a pack.”
Shit I thought. Did  this just happen again? Even a simple heist gone wrong. These cops were more villainous than I was. They must have a villain name. I had to ask.

“So do you guys have a name you go by?”

“Ugh jeez. Corrupt Cops?”
Wow good one. I would have never thought of that. 

“Alright kid well we should get going. Take care.” Lenny shook my hand and waved off as they got in their squad car. One could even see some hair follicles in the grill, probably from the jaywalker they had hit. 

I took out the pack the Cops had given me and began to smoke, each stick one step closer to cancer. This was just another small setback. I planned to hit once again in the future. My name would be well-known by heroes and villains alike. I would no longer be called “Misdaemenor,” by all my friends.
