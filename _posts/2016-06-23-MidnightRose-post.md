From the open window, the celestial bodies gazed at the figure busy at his desk. He did not turn to recognize them. He was caught up in his own project: Folding, creasing, fumbling. The art of his hands had just produced a fumbled creased folding. It was a rose, at least in the maker’s plan, but the result was indiscernible. It was sure to be confused with a flimsy cactus, a venus fly trap, or even a red potato. 

Swoosh. Another 3-pointer into the wired-trash bin beside his bed. A small success amidst a slew of failures. And with one paper left, this one had to be done right. Adjusting the dim reading lamp from the desk, he set up his studio for one last take at botanical paper. 

Glimmering outside, he ignored the crescent which begged for his attention. Intent on fixed folds, he flopped the sheet in front of him. The crimson color never looked more intimidating. His hands shook and sweat slipped from under his temples. He began to whisper to himself inaudibly: *Why?...worth it...for nothing…* The wind rustled the branches outside. A twig snapped his concentration. 

Clunk. This time no potato had even taken shape. It was a tumbleweed straight from the origami desert. It had clanked against the rim and fell astray next to the bottom of the bin. Rocking up from his chair, he slumped his way towards the missed shot. As he stretched out his hand, the celestial light waved frantically at an object in front of him. Taking notice, his eyes switched to the the previous rose he had made. In the bin, he saw the one real rose he had thrown out. The rough edges had been smoothed out by the moonlight and the ever-faint flickering of starlight made the rose breathe.
