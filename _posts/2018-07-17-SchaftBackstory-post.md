It is well known that by the marshes on the east side of Lake Esmull, a tribe of half orcs reside. Many call them the “Ashleaves,” due to constant smoking of Whortlekrungus which grows bountiful and wild in the area. There is constant euphoric white smoke surrounding the marsh, and many attribute it to the regular burning of Whortlekrungus done by the Ashleaves. 

The history behind the Ashleaves begins after the Great Pillage of Krunglelungus, the dominant Orc Leader two hundred years ago. Krunglelungus can be described in what we can consider in our perspective as the great Genghis Khan, spreading his seed across the land and fornicating with many races. Of which, humans were a regular pleasure enjoyed by Krunglelungus. After a near hundred years of domination in the area, the great reign of Krunglelungus fell, due to political infighting, inbreeding, and most importantly, an overdose of Black Grengal, more commonly known now in street terms as “Body Bag,” due to its high potential to cause overdose and death at the reward of the most ultimate euphoria. Those who have taken it and survived have reported “living their whole lives backwards to forwards, and then redoing all the mistakes they ever made.”

Krunglelungus left many neighboring towns and villages in the area bitter with resentment due to the high taxes Krunglelungus imposed to support his lavish lifestyle along with the many wives he took from the villages. Specifically, Half-Orcs in Vayasuh feeling discriminated after the fall of Krunglelungus, began to move to the almost-uninhabited marsh of Grisslebirch. The first Ashleaves initially regarded outsiders with contempt as they had moved away to keep themselves from the harsh judgement of the village. 

But as the saying goes in the land, “gold coins speak the smoothest of any”. The Ashleaves  discovered the growing of Whortlekrungus, more commonly known as “The Krung, Spiritleaf, Krungle’s Queen, the Chief of Sleep, Slarm, Shimmy-Shingle, Whort, Grengal’s Goodside (or shorter ‘Goodside’), Esmullia, the Tonguegus of Lungus to name a few, and with this discovery, they developed their main economy crop.  

The Ashleaves since their discovery have become the main cultivators of Whortlekrungus sharing their crop across the land to those villages and towns that accept it, and even potentially to those that don’t.  
******
But Alas, enough about the Ashleaves, this is a story about Schaft Phallus, the hero of this story. Schaft, grew up as most Ashleaves do in the area: smoking the Krung, cultivating it, and selling it to wholesalers who would take the crop to villages like Vayahsuh and beyond. His parents, both Half-Orcs, had known no life outside outside the Krung and Grisslebirch. They had both grown up uneducated, farming for the main wholesaler in the area Rammel “The Fecal King” Rectum. 

Now Rammel is an important character for our hero. Rammel was the go-to person for buying manure and selling crop. It was known that Rammel’s fertilizer was the best in town for growing Krung. In fact, Rammel would personally try the fecal matter he had in stock to ensure that the quality was to his liking. He was a rectal stuffing connoisseur, and for that, talk around the village too was that Rammel had a thing for putting his pole in the darkest hole. 

Rammel, had been long standing friends with the Phallus’ (Schaft’s Family), and when Schaft was growing up, he served as a godfather as we would know it from our perspective. He was Schaft’s “Kitkahpauk” which would roughly translate to “the one who takes care of the family after the beheading of the main caretaker in combat.” (Obviously really deep orc roots). Rammel looked after Schaft and regularly would treat Schaft to the finer things in life that many times a small marsh tribe would not see. He would bring the finest horse dungs from far off east where the once-glorious Orc Empire reigned (though smaller Orc Kingdoms still reside). Rammel and Schaft would frequently have “Dung Tastings” at his house and “shoot the shit,” while also eating it. This was always accompanied by of course, heavy puffs of  Tonguegus of Lungus. 

During their discussions, talk about Schaft’s future always came up. One discussion in particular directed Schaft to the hero we will know:
“Now my boy, I don’t see you as a simple Krung farmer.”

“How so, it is easy and I can lift big object up and down with ease. Living will be easy.”

“But there is so much more out there. How else do I score such delicacies?”

“You know people, you have fine tastes.”

“Ah yes my boy, but so do you. No one else in town enjoys the finest dung as you and I do. You have a higher calling”

“But what?”

“You are blessed with muscles bigger than Krunglelungus himself! You have choked down even the dirtiest, rotting dung I carry for those who want the cheap stuff. You have a good heart. The only thing I can think of is becoming a warrior for Ehlonna, the goddess which has brought me  good fortune. In serving her, you shall bring your family great honor, and me great pride”
They carried on with the talk for hours, and later that night Schaft dreamed of Ehlonna calling out to him as he slept.  He had decided to become a warrior for Ehlonna. 

Now the question, how was Schaft knighted as a Paladin? Well Paladins themselves have always been more of a non-orcish construct. In fact, the Orc Army of Krunglelungus did not have within their ranks, a knight that both behaved as a warrior and as a shield of life. Orc medicine during combat consisted of brutal severing of limbs, often with bare hands, to prevent sepsis; or if a fire was handy, a pour-over of kerosene,a scorched ligament, and one shrieking yell.

Half-Orcs, being half human half Orc, integrated into their culture the idea of a warrior with a shield, the “Life Shield”, the closest interpretation we see as a “paladin.” 

In Grisslebirch, the goddess Ehlonna is believed to preside and balance the harmony of life. Many who do become warriors of Ehlonna, are “Life Shields.” She speaks to them in a dream and give them visions of people in danger, often hinting that their future lies in protecting them. Schaft the night of his dream, dreamed of Rammus. He couldn’t see the danger, it looked like a figure, or figures, and the place was obscure. The only thing he knew for sure was feeling Ehlonna’s power surging through him and intense crisis. He awoke in dripping sweat, and that day,  set off to train at the small Ehlonna shine where a small cabal of Ashleaves trained to become warriors.

After a year of training, Schaft once had begun talking with Rammus back home.
“So my boy, I heard you left the Shrine. Is it much, the training?”
“I read book. So hard to read. But good at combat. Broke instructor’s back on accident”
“So you got kicked out?”
“Yes, but Ehlonna talked to me. She still with me.”
“Ah good my boy, well the good thing is you tried. That is a tough break”
“What do I do now?”
“Well you can always help me with the business here. I have plenty of tasks.”
“Sure, what is needed?”
“Ahh, well I recently started a new Krung connection with Vayahsuh. I know an ‘apothecary’ who sells on the down-low since it’s banned there. Recently though, he has disappeared. I have an address here. Go check on him. His name is ‘Grunkle Sherkehs’.”

And with the end of the conversation is the beginning of the story for our hero. Schaft left Grisslebirch for the first time, heading to Vayahsuh, to help Rammus with an errand, little did he know what adventures await him. 




Extra Lore:
As known by many, Orc’s are a species of the Kingdom that have a hard time controlling their emotions and have a bloodlust stronger than most. Half orcs share this similar trait and it is often times hard to control after a certain level. When an half-orc is deeply enraged, the only way the feeling ends is normally with one or the other in a body bag. The half-orcs in Grisslewood are particularly calm for most half-orcs due to the constant consumption of Krung, but this has its drawbacks. Many half-orcs suffering from withdrawal often find their orcish rage harder to control.
