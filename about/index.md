## My Life before the Hood

They spoke of me only in code names. For the longest time, it was not even known if I had a name. The Ghost, the Enigma, the Shifting Sands... were just a few. Most of my days were spent in the shadows. Going from one dark room to another...to another. One would not be incorrect to see the lights turn off and exclaim "Miguel!", because that is what I would be...darkness. But it was not always this way..."
